# **Final Project - Python Programming Academic Classes**

# Home Budget Manager

Home Budget Manager is an application created using the **Tkinter** library that allows users to manage their home budget. The application enables users to add expenses and incomes, track them across different categories, and visualize data in the form of charts and tables with records. Additionally, it offers an option to set limits for expense categories and view detailed financial data. All data is stored and managed using `.csv` files.

When the program is launched, if the files `budget_data.csv` and `categories.csv` are not found, they are automatically created with default values, allowing the user to start using the application immediately without manually adding data. The `budget_data.csv` file will contain only the column headers as the first record, while the `categories.csv` file will include sample categories with predefined limits. The data in both files can be edited during program execution as well as manually.

For example, after filling in or adding records, the files will look as follows:
(You can use these data to achieve nice effects in the charts)
